# gravel
just low quality pebble clone  
  
not finished, but you can see progress here - I will likely return to this in the summer, after making at least 8 versions of the pcb and ap testing coming up i need to take a break  
the goal is to design a smart watch, similar to the pebble watch, using an esp32  
  
inspiration is taken from [repebble.com](https://repebble.com/), the [pinetime](https://pine64.org/devices/pinetime/), the [bangle.js](https://banglejs.com/) and [watchy](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sqfmi/watchy)
